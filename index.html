            <p>Hi I'm Piers, a software developer currently working full time as an iOS Developer.</p>
            <p>Swift is my programming language of choice and I am really excited about it's potential use outside of the Apple ecosystem, particuarly server-side Swift. 
                    I sponsor <a href='https://github.com/sponsors/vapor'>Vapor</a> because I think it is awesome and it would be amazing to be able to use Swift on the frontend and backend for total global domination.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I am a big Manchester united fan, enjoy going to the gym, reading, and working on side projects. 
                    Having done Energy Management and Sustainability for a degree at University but not used it since, I am hoping to create an app idea related to sustainability for my next side project</p>
            <p>The best place to get hold of me is via <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/piers-ebdon/'>linkedin</a>. However, I am not currently looking for new opportunities.</p>
